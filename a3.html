    I feel like Colin Firth today, but not because I’ve won any awards. In his acceptance speech at the Oscars recently, Firth admitted to “stirrings” which could, at any moment, set his legs to dancing.

For my entire life, the road to New Orleans has made me want to second line all the way, so I know those stirrings. I’ll be dancing down the river this week to visit with gardeners and photograph their gardens, and, yes, do a little parading.
