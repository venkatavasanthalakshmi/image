Cockatoos are lively, affectionate birds that become an owner's best friendâ€”they're even capable of mimicking your words if you're around them long enough. There are 21 species of cockatoos in the world, with the most common species in captivity including the Moluccan, Goffin's, umbrella, sulfur-crested (greater and lesser), and bare-eyed cockatoos.

All cockatoos can be identified by a crest that can be lifted and lowered. The cockatoo bird family is primarily divided into two subfamilies: white cockatoos (Cacatua species) and dark cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus species). There are a few outlying species that do not fit into either category, like cockatiels, which are the smallest member of the cockatoo family.
