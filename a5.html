Trumpeter swans are dabblers and eat aquatic plants, fish, and bugs. They are native to North America and are currently undergoing a population management program. Trumpeters first received nationwide protection in 1918, the year that the United States, Canada, and Mexico signed the Migratory Bird Treaty. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has a Wildlife Species Restoration project that is gradually acclimating swans to their new environment before fully releasing them back into the wild. Several institutions are collaborating with US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Trumpeter Swan Society to begin this soft release program. At WCSâ€™s Bronx Zoo, we have joined the effort.

Earlier this year, our breeding pair of trumpeter swans successfully reared one cygnet (above). The little female was hatched on June 29, 2018. Her parents raised her for 106 days before she was weaned on September 21. Human interaction was minimal to help ensure her transition back into the wild would go smoothly.
